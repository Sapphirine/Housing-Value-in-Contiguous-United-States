# Housing-Value-in-Contiguous-United-States
# In this paper, we utilized regression model to evaluate housing value in Contiguous United States. The ROIC (return on invested capital) of house value over time provides a clear instruction for investors. We conducted horizontal comparison of house prices with different features such as area, number of rooms, MHI, and average days on market as well as vertical comparison (e.g., ROIC over time) to predict future house prices. In order to do so, proper regression models are implemented and tested. The output is displayed in a reader friendly form on our website.
